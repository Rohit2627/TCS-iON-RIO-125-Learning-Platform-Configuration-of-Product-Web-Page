# TCS-iON-RIO-125-Learning-Platform-Configuration-of-Product-Web-Page


I have created a website for Learning Platform Configuration of Product Web Page. On the homepage, I've designed an attractive layout. In the navigation section, I've included links for search, home, gallery, contact, and about us to facilitate navigation.

On the homepage, I've integrated dummy login and sign-up pages. Users can either log in or sign up to access their user profile page, namely product.html. If they have an account, they can proceed to login; otherwise, they can register.

Upon successful login with static credentials, users are directed to the product.html page. Here, another navigation bar is available, containing links such as My Products, Contact, About, and Profile sections.

If users wish to purchase a product, they can click on the desired product, which will redirect them to the info.html page. On this page, users provide information such as first name, last name, and date of birth. A unique code is generated based on this information. After filling in the code and clicking submit, the selected product is added to the user's My Products section.

Finally, users can log out of the system.
